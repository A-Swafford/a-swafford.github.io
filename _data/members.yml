  bio: Andrew Swafford is pursuing his Ph.D. studying the macroevolution of complex traits and their underlying genetic components.  Andrew is currently researching the origin of animal visual proteins, opsins, and the correlative effects environment may have on thier evolution.  Although primarily interested in vision, Andrew is also involved with projects about the evolution of multimodal sensory suites and creating new bioinformatic approaches to analyze big data.

  bio: David is a PhD student in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. David earned a Master’s degree in experimental condensed matter physics at Brigham Young University where he fabricated and characterized thin-films and carbon nanotubes used in nanostructured high capacity battery electrodes and in X-ray windows. As an undergraduate, David studied theoretical physics and researched the evolution of chaotic systems using neural networks at Westminster College. He is a trainee in the NSF IGERT FLAMEL program, and one of the lead developers on PyMKS materials informatics toolkit.
